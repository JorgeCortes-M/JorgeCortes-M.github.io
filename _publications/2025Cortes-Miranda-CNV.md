This study investigates copy number variations (CNVs) in the silverside fish *Basilichthys microlepidotus* inhabiting the Maipo River basin in central Chile. The research focuses on how chronic pollution influences genetic variations, specifically CNVs, as a potential adaptive mechanism in fish populations exposed to anthropogenic stressors. The findings contribute to understanding the genomic response of freshwater species to environmental pollution.
