This research employs genome scans to detect signals of natural selection associated with pollution in populations of *Basilichthys microlepidotus*. The study identifies genomic regions that may be under selection pressure due to chronic exposure to environmental pollutants, providing insights into the evolutionary adaptation of this endemic Chilean species.
