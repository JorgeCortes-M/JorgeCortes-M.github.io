This study analyzes the whole-transcriptome expression and the specific "chemical-defensome" of *Basilichthys microlepidotus* to understand its physiological and genetic responses to chronic pollution in the Maipo River basin. By comparing gene expression profiles between polluted and unpolluted sites, the research identifies key genes and pathways involved in the detoxification and stress response mechanisms of this endemic fish species.
