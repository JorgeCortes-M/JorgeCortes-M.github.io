# About
------
I am Jorge, a Ph.D student at the Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile in the [Ecological Sciences Department](http://ciencias.uchile.cl/departamentos/ciencias-ecologicas/presentacion.html). I'm a biotechnologist but my research is focus on microevolution in polluted environtments. I love teach and scientific communication, I'm recently exploring those areas, and the creation of this site is related with them. Also, lately I'm learning deeply about web develop and other computer sciences and I'm trying to merge all this differents pations in this site.

# My research
------
I'm focus on microevolutionary processes that natural populations experience related to chronic pollution exposure. For this purpose I'm currently using different approaches based on omics. In the past I've learned about population genetics and his applications to this problems, now I'm learning about epigenetics and his impact on microevolutionary processes on genes families.

# Background
------
I obtained my biotechnologist degree at Universidad de Chile, and now I'm Ph.D candidate at the same University in ecological and evolutionary sciences. The last two years I have been teaching Ecology for undergradute and postgraduate students and working on my doctoral thesis.
