# About me

I am Jorge, a PhD student at the University of Chile, Santiago, Chile, in the [Department of Ecological Sciences](http://ciencias.uchile.cl/departamentos/ciencias-ecologicas/presentacion.html). I graduated as a biotechnologist, but my research focus has been more related to microevolutionary processes in polluted environments. I love teaching and scientific communication; I have recently been exploring these areas, and the creation of this site goes hand in hand with that. Lately, I have been learning heavily about data analysis and other branches of computer science, which I intend to merge with all my base knowledge on this site.

# My research

At this moment, I have been focused on investigating microevolutionary processes that natural populations experience related to chronic exposure to pollution. In my doctoral project, I am using various methodologies to account for these phenomena. In particular, I hope to unveil genetic and epigenetic changes that differentiate populations subjected to these scenarios and how they could, eventually, interact with microevolutionary processes.
